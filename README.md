## **Mod/Datapack for Minecraft: Java Edition**

Fear the dark like never before. Lights Out turns Minecraft's night into a near pitch-black abyss, where only the brave (and well-lit) survive.

## ATTENTION
Using a dynamic lights mod/datapack alongside this pack will ruin the challenge of the darkness. If you're okay with this, go for it, but if you want the true Lights Out experience we highly recommend leaving your dynamic lights mods off.
